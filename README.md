Website of the artist Edson Pavoni.

Edson Pavoni (São Paulo, 1984) is an artist and technologist who proposes sensitive imaginaries for our shared ideas of connection.

His practice, which includes architectural-scale installations, algorithms and digital-based fabrications, AI generated images, poetry, photography, digital platforms and even satellite technology, aims to investigate human intimacy in its intersection with technology.

Through collaborative methods, Pavoni's works create interactive experiences that have the public's participation at its core. As is the case of the "Inumeráveis Memorial", a volunteer-based platform contributing to the humanization of the media coverage regarding the pandemic in Brazil, his works are able to engage thousands of people and have been featured in major newsletters and channels such as CNN, Al Jazeera, Estadão, Globo, El País, and more.

His work has also unfolded in educational courses and lectures, such as "Building memory through writing - the Inumeráveis Method", taught by the artist and the project volunteers and promoted by UNICAMP, in Brazil. 

In recent years, Pavoni's production has been able to reach an estimate of 1 in every 34 Brazilians. He has shown at Biennials such as the 13th Mercosul Biennial in Porto Alegre, Brazil, and the IX International Biennale of Contemporary Art in Tashkent, Uzbekistan.

His works have been exhibited in New York, Beijing, Singapore, Dubai, Lisbon and Rio de Janeiro, amongst others cities, and have been presented at institutions such as the Ludwig Museum of Contemporary Art in Budapest, Hungary; Inhotim Institute, Brazil; and at the Design and Fashion Museum of Lisbon, Portugal. His artworks have been commissioned by companies such as Google, Klabin, NuBank, and Accenture.

With over 20 years of experience helping creators to use new technologies for propositions in art, communication and architecture, Pavoni has been a part of creative teams that led projects commissioned by enterprises such as the 2016 Rio Olympics and the Inter American Development Bank (IDB).

Pavoni was recognized as one of the 50 most innovative Brazilian professionals by Proxxima Magazine in 2016 and has received two consecutive IF Design Awards in 2017 and 2018. He still contributes to selected and technologically innovative projects through the Spaces&Creatures studio, which he founded in 2010.

He lives and works in São Paulo.
